**Build, bundle & ship your Rust WASM application to the web.**
<br/>
*‚ÄùPack your things, we‚Äôre going on an adventure!‚Äù ~ Ferris*

Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Trunk uses a simple, optional-config pattern for building & bundling WASM, JS snippets & other assets (images, css, scss) via a source HTML file.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a forked version of `trunk`, adding features and bug fixes which didn't get merged into trunk so far.
Replace `trunk` with `trunk-ng` for all operations.

**üì¶ Dev server** - Trunk ships with a built-in server for rapid development workflows, as well as support for HTTP & WebSocket proxies.

**üèó Change detection** - Trunk watches your application for changes and triggers builds for you, including automatic browser reloading.
